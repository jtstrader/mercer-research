fn main() {
    // expectation: be able to create a CNN with any given number of layers and have those layers
    // stored in some sort of struct. Something maybe like this? ->
    //
    // let model = MyCNNStruct::new(num_convolutional_layers, num_fully_connected_layers, activation_function)
    //
    // of course, this is just a concept and might change, but this should help build the foundations of the library functions
