\section{Conclusion}
Writing idiomatic Rust will generally lead to more performant code than idiomatic Python, JavaScript, R, or Julia. The fact
of the matter is that these languages, as optimized as they are, will always have a barrier in performance for solving
general purpose tasks. Sure, these languages have their own optimizations for very specific jobs, but as soon as another
problem comes their way, the language may not be able to keep up.

This is why countless companies have pushed for their backends to be rewritten in Rust from other languages. For instance,
in 2020 Discord switched from using Go for their backend services to Rust citing performance problems due to Go's garbage
collector.~\cite{discord}
